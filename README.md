# Data-Structure-and-Algorithm-DSA-project

This is the final project of the algorithms and data structures course at Politecnico di Milano. The reference professor is Davide Martinenghi and the project was assessed 30L/30.

The goal is to develop a program that meets the specifications ([available here](Specifiche_di_progetto.pdf)) in the most efficient way. The rating is based on time and memory efficiency, the code developed used half the time and a third of the available memory to take 30L.
