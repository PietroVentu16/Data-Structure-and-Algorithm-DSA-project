# Data-Structure-and-Algorithm-DSA-project

This is the final project of the algorithms and data structures course at Politecnico di Milano. The reference professor is Davide Martinenghi and the project was assessed 30L/30.

The goal is to develop a program that meets the specifications ([available here](Specifiche_di_progetto.pdf)) in the most efficient way. The rating is based on time and memory efficiency, the code developed used half the time and a third of the available memory to take 30L.

Data structures:\n
-Binary tree to store station's informations (over 100k stations to search, average O(log n) worst case O(n))\n
-Ordered list to store car's information (besides the ordered insertion time of O(n), the access time is O(1))\n
-Matrix to elaborate some parts of the tree's data\n
The algorithm is an heuristic function, Dijkstra's alorithm was taken in consideration but the heuristic function worked fine.
